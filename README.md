# Baytek Gutenberg Blocks

A WordPress plugin for housing handy Gutenberg blocks not included in core yet or custom ones required by your site. 

This plugin is intended to be a starting point for your custom built site, and not a site builder plugin that you will continually update. Feel free to hack and slash the included blocks as needed to achieve your desired result but also understand that you are supporting it moving forward. Updates will be made to the plugin as Gutenberg evolves to maintain compatability as some features become deprecated so you may need to refactor some code in the future. The blocks are written the objective of staying close to and consistent with Gutenberg coding practices to maximize compatability without modification but the platform is constantly changing so it can't be ruled out entirely.

The included blocks as built with a minimalist approach with a focus on content (or the data model if you will) and letting the theme dictate the presentation. This is to avoid inconsistencies in the presentation by removing a lot of design aspects from Gutenberg (eg. background and text colors) and relying on the active theme to styling theme to fit the design. There are some basic styles included for the blocks so they should still display and function "out of the box" but customization is encouraged by the theme developer.

If you are not familiar with WordPress theme, plugin or Gutenberg development you might be better served using a premium Gutenberg blocks plugin, or page builder with paid support and more design functionality.
